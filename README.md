# Introduction to AI: Final Project

Introduction to AI is a course I took in Ateneo de Manila University. For our final project, we were tasked to use machine learning algorithms on a chosen dataset found online.
My group decided to use Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors to try to predict who will win a tic-tac-toe game based on finished "boards" as found in `tic-tac-toe.data`.
A description of the project and its results are found in `final_presentation.pdf`.
